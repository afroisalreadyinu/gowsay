A cowsay implementation as a library. Forked from
https://github.com/syohex/gowsay. Sample use:

#+BEGIN_SRC Go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"gowsay"
)

func main() {
	output, _ := gowsay.MakeCow("Hello There", gowsay.Mooptions{})
	fmt.Println(output)
}
#+END_SRC

Intended as demo in a blog post.
